# MafiaRB

Implementation of the classic game Mafia, to be run in the command line.

For use when we forget to bring cards (e.g. always), and have access to a computer (e.g. always).

Ratios are currently adjusted to our preferences. Currently, 8 is the maximum number of players allowed, because we don't have many friends.

There is no nurse implemented, partially because this project is hacked together, but mostly because the nurse is overpowered and makes the game unfun and heavily chance-based.

## Usage

    load 'mafia.rb'
    Mafia.play
