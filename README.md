# MafiaRB

Implementation of the classic game Mafia, to be run in the command line.

For use when we forget to bring cards (e.g. always, because we are forgetful), and have access to a computer (e.g. always, because we are nerds).

Ratios are currently adjusted to our preferences. Currently, 11 is the maximum number of players allowed, because we don't have many friends.

There is no nurse implemented, partially because this project is hacked together, but mostly because we think the nurse is overpowered and makes the game unfun and heavily chance-based. 

## Usage

Clone the repo and run the file `mafia.rb`.

    cd mafia-rb
    ruby mafia.rb
